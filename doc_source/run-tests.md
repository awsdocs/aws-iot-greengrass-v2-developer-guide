# Run the AWS IoT Greengrass qualification suite<a name="run-tests"></a>

After you [set the required configuration](set-config.md), you can start the tests\. The runtime of the full test suite depends on your hardware\. For reference, it takes approximately 30 minutes to complete the full test suite on a Raspberry Pi 3B\.

Use the following `run-suite` command to run a suite of tests\.

```
devicetester_[linux | mac | win]_x86-64 run-suite  \
    --suite-id suite-id  \
    --group-id group-id  \
    --pool-id your-device-pool \
    --test-id test-id  \
    --update-idt y|n  \
    --userdata userdata.json
```

All options are optional\. For example, you can omit `pool-id` if you have only one device pool, which is a set of identical devices, defined in your `device.json` file\. Or, you can omit `suite-id` if you want to run the latest test suite version in the `tests` folder\.

**Note**  
IDT prompts you if a newer test suite version is available online\. For more information, see [Test suite versions](idt-greengrass-qualification.md#idt-test-suite-versions)\.

## Example commands to run the qualification suite<a name="idt-run-suite-examples"></a>

The following command line examples show you how to run the qualification tests for a device pool\. For more information about `run-suite` and other IDT commands, see [IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass V2 commands](#bk-cli)\.

Use the following command to run all test groups in a specified test suite\. The `list-suites` command lists the test suites that are in the `tests` folder\.

```
devicetester_[linux | mac | win]_x86-64 run-suite \
    --suite-id GGV2Q_1.0.0 \
    --pool-id <pool-id> \
    --userdata userdata.json
```

Use the following command to run a specific test group in a test suite\. The `list-groups` command lists the test groups in a test suite\.

```
devicetester_[linux | mac | win]_x86-64 run-suite \
    --suite-id GGV2Q_1.0.0 \
    --group-id <group-id> \
    --pool-id <pool-id> \
    --userdata userdata.json
```

Use the following command to run a specific test case in a test group\.

```
devicetester_[linux | mac | win]_x86-64 run-suite \
    --group-id <group-id> \
    --test-id <test-id> \
    --userdata userdata.json
```

Use the following command to run multiple test cases in a test group\.

```
devicetester_[linux | mac | win]_x86-64 run-suite \
    --group-id <group-id> \
    --test-id <test-id1>,<test-id2>
    --userdata userdata.json
```

Use the following command to list all of the test cases in a test group\.

```
devicetester_[linux | mac | win]_x86-64 list-test-cases --group-id <group-id>
```

We recommend that you run the full qualification test suite, which runs test group dependencies in the correct order\. If you choose to run specific test groups, we recommend that you first run the dependency checker test group to make sure all Greengrass dependencies are installed before you run related test groups\. For example:
+ Run `coredependencies` before running core qualification test groups\.

## IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass V2 commands<a name="bk-cli"></a>

The IDT commands are located in the `<device-tester-extract-location>/bin` directory\. To run a test suite, you provide the command in the following format:

`help`  <a name="idt-command-help"></a>
Lists information about the specified command\.

`list-groups`  <a name="idt-command-list-groups"></a>
Lists the groups in a given test suite\.

`list-suites`  <a name="idt-command-list-suites"></a>
Lists the available test suites\.

`list-supported-products`  
Lists the supported products, in this case AWS IoT Greengrass versions, and test suite versions for the current IDT version\.

`list-test-cases`  
Lists the test cases in a given test group\. The following option is supported:  
+ `group-id`\. The test group to search for\. This option is required and must specify a single group\.

`run-suite`  
Runs a suite of tests on a pool of devices\. The following are some supported options:  
+ `suite-id`\. The test suite version to run\. If not specified, IDT uses the latest version in the `tests` folder\.
+ `group-id`\. The test groups to run, as a comma\-separated list\. If not specified, IDT runs all appropriate test groups in the test suite depending on the configured settings in `device.json`\. IDT doesn't run any test groups that the device doesn't support based on your configured settings, even if those test groups are specified in the `group-id` list\.
+ `test-id`\. The test cases to run, as a comma\-separated list\. When specified, `group-id` must specify a single group\.
+ `pool-id`\. The device pool to test\. You must specify a pool if you have multiple device pools defined in your `device.json` file\.
+ `stop-on-first-failure`\. Configures IDT to stop running on the first failure\. Use this option with `group-id` when you want to debug the specified test groups\. Do not use this option when running a full test\-suite to generate a qualification report\.
+ `update-idt`\. Sets the response for the prompt to update IDT\. The `Y` response stops the test execution if IDT detects there is a newer version\. The `N` response continues the test execution\.
+ `userdata`\. The full path to the `userdata.json` file that contains information about test artifact paths\. This option is required for the `run-suite` command\. The `userdata.json` file must be located in the *devicetester\_extract\_location*/devicetester\_ggv2\_*\[win\|mac\|linux\]*/configs/ directory\.
For more information about `run-suite` options, use the `help` option:  

```
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite -h
```
