# AWS\-provided components<a name="public-components"></a>

AWS IoT Greengrass provides and maintains prebuilt components that you can deploy to your devices\. These components include features \(such as stream manager\), AWS IoT Greengrass V1 connectors \(such as CloudWatch metrics\), and local development tools \(such as the AWS IoT Greengrass CLI\)\. You can [deploy these components](manage-deployments.md) to your devices for their standalone functionality, or you can use them as dependencies in your [custom Greengrass components](develop-greengrass-components.md)\.

**Note**  <a name="component-nucleus-dependency-update-note"></a>
Several AWS\-provided components depend on specific minor versions of the Greengrass nucleus\. Because of this dependency, you need to update these components when you update the Greengrass nucleus to a new minor version\. For information about the specific versions of the nucleus that each component depends on, see the corresponding component topic\. For more information about updating the nucleus, see [Update the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software \(OTA\)](update-greengrass-core-v2.md)\.
