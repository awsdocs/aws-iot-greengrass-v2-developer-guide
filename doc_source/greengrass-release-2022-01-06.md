## Public component updates<a name="greengrass-2022-01-06-components"></a>

The following table lists AWS\-provided components that include new and updated features\.

**Important**  <a name="component-patch-update-note"></a>
<a name="component-patch-update"></a>When you deploy a component, AWS IoT Greengrass installs the latest supported versions of all of that component's dependencies\. Because of this, new patch versions of AWS\-provided public components might be automatically deployed to your core devices if you add new devices to a thing group, or you update the deployment that targets those devices\. Some automatic updates, such as a nucleus update, can cause your devices to restart unexpectedly\.   
<a name="component-version-pinning"></a>To prevent unintended updates for a component that is running on your device, we recommend that you directly include your preferred version of that component when you [create a deployment](create-deployments.md)\. For more information about update behavior for AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, see [Update the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software \(OTA\)](update-greengrass-core-v2.md)\.
