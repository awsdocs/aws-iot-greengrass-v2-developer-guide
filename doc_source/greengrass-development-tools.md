# AWS IoT Greengrass development tools<a name="greengrass-development-tools"></a>

Use AWS IoT Greengrass development tools to create, test, build, publish, and deploy custom Greengrass components\.
+ **[Greengrass Development Kit CLI](greengrass-development-kit-cli.md)**

  Use the AWS IoT Greengrass Development Kit Command\-Line Interface \(GDK CLI\) in your local development environment to create components from templates and community components in the [Greengrass Software Catalog](greengrass-software-catalog.md)\. You can use the GDK CLI to build the component and publish the component to the AWS IoT Greengrass service as a private component in your AWS account\.
+ **[Greengrass Command Line Interface](gg-cli.md)**

  Use the Greengrass Command Line Interface \(Greengrass CLI\) on Greengrass core devices to deploy and debug Greengrass components\. The Greengrass CLI is a component that you can deploy to your core devices to create local deployments, view details about installed components, and explore log files\.
+ **[Local debug console](local-debug-console-component.md)**

  Use the local debug console on Greengrass core devices to deploy and debug Greengrass components using a local dashboard web interface\. The local debug console is a component that you can deploy to your core devices to create local deployments and view details about installed components\.

AWS IoT Greengrass also provides the following SDKs that you can use in custom Greengrass components:
+ The AWS IoT Device SDK, which contains the interprocess communication \(IPC\) library\. For more information, see [Use the AWS IoT Device SDK to communicate with the Greengrass nucleus, other components, and AWS IoT CoreCommunicate with the Greengrass nucleus, other components, and AWS IoT Core](interprocess-communication.md)\.
+ The Stream Manager SDK, which you can use to transfer data streams to the AWS Cloud\. For more information, see [Manage data streams on Greengrass core devices](manage-data-streams.md)\.
