# Test client device communications<a name="test-client-device-communications"></a>

Client devices can use the AWS IoT Device SDK to discover, connect, and communicate with a core device\. You can use the Greengrass discovery client in the AWS IoT Device SDK to use the [Greengrass discovery API](greengrass-discover-api.md), which returns information about core devices to which a client device can connect\. The API response includes MQTT broker endpoints to connect and certificates to use to verify the identity of each core device\. Then, the client device can try each endpoint until it successfully connects to a core device\.

Client devices can discover only core devices to which you associate them\. Before you test communications between a client device and a core device, you must associate the client device to the core device\. For more information, see [Associate client devices](associate-client-devices.md)\.

The Greengrass discovery API returns the core device MQTT broker endpoints that you specify\. You can use the [IP detector component](ip-detector-component.md) to manage these endpoints for you, or you can manually manage them for each core device\. For more information, see [Manage core device endpoints](manage-core-device-endpoints.md)\.

**Note**  
To use the Greengrass discovery API, a client device must have the `greengrass:Discover` permission\. For more information, see [Minimal AWS IoT policy for client devices](device-auth.md#client-device-minimal-iot-policy)\.

The AWS IoT Device SDK is available in multiple programming languages\. For more information, see [AWS IoT Device SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-sdks.html) in the *AWS IoT Core Developer Guide*\.

## Test communications \(Python\)<a name="test-client-device-communications-python"></a>

In this section, you use Greengrass discovery sample in the [AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2) to test communications between a client device and a core device\.

**Important**  
To use the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python, a device must run Python 3\.6 or later\.

**To test communications \(AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python\)**

1. <a name="download-iot-device-sdk-python-v2"></a>Download and install the [AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2) to the AWS IoT thing to connect as a client device\.

   On the client device, do the following:

   1. Clone the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python repository to download it\.

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2.git
      ```

   1. Install the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python\.

      ```
      python3 -m pip install --user ./aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2
      ```

1. <a name="cd-iot-device-sdk-python-v2"></a>Change to the samples folder in the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python\.

   ```
   cd aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2/samples
   ```

1. <a name="test-client-device-communications-application-intro"></a>Run the sample Greengrass discovery application\. This application expects arguments that specify the client device thing name, the MQTT topic and message to use, and the certificates that authenticate and secure the connection\. The following example sends a Hello World message to the `clients/MyClientDevice1/hello/world` topic\.<a name="test-client-device-communications-application-command-replace"></a>
   + Replace *MyClientDevice1* with the client device's thing name\.
   + Replace *\~/certs/AmazonRootCA1\.pem* with the path to the Amazon root CA certificate on the client device\.
   + Replace *\~/certs/device\.pem\.crt* with the path to the device certificate on the client device\.
   + Replace *\~/certs/private\.pem\.key* with the path to the private key file on the client device\.
   + Replace *us\-east\-1* with the AWS Region where your client device and core device operate\.

   ```
   python3 basic_discovery.py \
     --thing_name MyClientDevice1 \
     --topic 'clients/MyClientDevice1/hello/world' \
     --message 'Hello World!' \
     --ca_file ~/certs/AmazonRootCA1.pem \
     --cert ~/certs/device.pem.crt \
     --key ~/certs/private.pem.key \
     --region us-east-1 \
     --verbosity Warn
   ```

   <a name="test-client-device-communications-application-output-intro"></a>The discovery sample application sends the message 10 times and disconnects\. It also subscribes to the same topic where it publishes messages\. If the output indicates that the application received MQTT messages on the topic, the client device can successfully communicate with the core device\.
