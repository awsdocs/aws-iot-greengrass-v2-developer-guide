# DLR runtime<a name="dlr-component"></a>

The DLR runtime component \(`variant.DLR`\) contains a script that installs [Deep Learning Runtime](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr) \(DLR\) and its dependencies in a virtual environment on your device\. The [DLR image classification](dlr-image-classification-component.md) and [DLR object detection](dlr-object-detection-component.md) components use this component as a dependency for installing DLR\. Component version 1\.6\.x installs DLR v1\.6\.0 and component version 1\.3\.x installs DLR v1\.3\.0\. 

To use a different runtime, you can use the recipe of this component as a template to [create a custom machine learning component](ml-customization.md)\.

## Versions<a name="dlr-component-versions"></a>

This component has the following versions:
+ 1\.6\.x
+ 1\.3\.x

## Type<a name="dlr-component-type"></a>

<a name="public-component-type-generic"></a>This <a name="public-component-type-generic-phrase"></a>component is a generic component \(`aws.greengrass.generic`\)\. The [Greengrass nucleus](greengrass-nucleus-component.md) runs the component's lifecycle scripts\.

<a name="public-component-type-more-information"></a>For more information, see [Component types](develop-greengrass-components.md#component-types)\.

## Operating system<a name="dlr-component-os-support"></a>

This component can be installed on core devices that run the following operating systems:
+ Linux
+ Windows

## Requirements<a name="dlr-component-requirements"></a>

This component has the following requirements:<a name="ml-component-requirements"></a>
+ On Greengrass core devices running Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu 18\.04, [GNU C Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) \(glibc\) version 2\.27 or later installed on the device\.
+ On Armv7l devices, such as Raspberry Pi, dependencies for OpenCV\-Python installed on the device\. Run the following command to install the dependencies\.

  ```
  sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7 libilmbase23 libopenexr-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libgtk-3-0 libwebp-dev
  ```
+ Raspberry Pi devices that run Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye must meet the following requirements:
  + NumPy 1\.22\.4 or later installed on the device\. Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye includes an earlier version of NumPy, so you can run the following command to upgrade NumPy on the device\.

    ```
    pip3 install --upgrade numpy
    ```
  + The legacy camera stack enabled on the device\. Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye includes a new camera stack that is enabled by default and isn't compatible, so you must enable the legacy camera stack\.<a name="raspberry-pi-bullseye-enable-legacy-camera-stack"></a>

**To enable the legacy camera stack**

    1. Run the following command to open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool\.

       ```
       sudo raspi-config
       ```

    1. Select **Interface Options**\.

    1. Select **Legacy camera** to enable the legacy camera stack\.

    1. Reboot the Raspberry Pi\.

### Endpoints and ports<a name="dlr-component-endpoints"></a>

By default, this component uses an installer script to install packages using the `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, and `pip` commands, depending on what platform the core device uses\. This component must be able to perform outbound requests to various package indexes and repositories to run the installer script\. To allow this component's outbound traffic through a proxy or firewall, you must identify the endpoints for the package indexes and repositories where your core device connects to install\.

Consider the following when you identify endpoints required for this component's install script:
+ The endpoints depend on the core device's platform\. For example, a core device that runs Ubuntu uses `apt` rather than `yum` or `brew`\. Additionally, devices that use the same package index might have different source lists, so they might retrieve packages from different repositories\.
+ The endpoints might differ between multiple devices that use the same package index, because each device has its own source lists that define where to retrieve packages\.
+ The endpoints might change over time\. Each package index provides the URLs of the repositories where you download packages, and the owner of a package can change what URLs the package index provides\.

For more information about the dependencies that this component installs, and how to disable the installer script, see the [UseInstaller](#dlr-component-config-useinstaller-term) configuration parameter\.

For more information about endpoints and ports required for basic operation, see [Allow device traffic through a proxy or firewall](allow-device-traffic.md)\.

## Configuration<a name="dlr-component-configuration"></a>

This component provides the following configuration parameters that you can customize when you deploy the component\.

`MLRootPath`  
<a name="ml-config-mlrootpath-desc"></a>\(Optional\) The path of the folder on Linux core devices where inference components read images and write inference results\. You can modify this value to any location on your device to which the user running this component has read/write access\.  
<a name="ml-config-mlrootpath-default-dlr"></a>Default: `/greengrass/v2/work/variant.DLR/greengrass_ml`

`WindowsMLRootPath`  
This feature is available in v1\.6\.6 and later of this component\.  
<a name="ml-config-windowsmlrootpath-desc"></a>\(Optional\) The path of the folder on Windows core device where inference components read images and write inference results\. You can modify this value to any location on your device to which the user running this component has read/write access\.  
<a name="ml-config-windowsmlrootpath-default-dlr"></a>Default: `C:\greengrass\v2\work\variant.DLR\greengrass_ml`

  `UseInstaller`   
<a name="ml-config-useinstaller-desc-dlr"></a>\(Optional\) String value that defines whether to use the installer script in this component to install DLR and its dependencies\. Supported values are `true` and `false`\.   <a name="ml-config-useinstaller-libraries-dlr"></a>

Set this value to `false` if you want to use a custom script for DLR installation, or if you want to include runtime dependencies in a pre\-built Linux image\. To use this component with the AWS\-provided DLR inference components, install the following libraries, including any dependencies, and make them available to the system user, such as `ggc_user`, that runs the ML components\.
+ [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3\.7 or later, including `pip` for your version of Python\.
+ [Deep Learning Runtime](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr) v1\.6\.0
+ [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)\.
+ [OpenCV\-Python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)\.
+ [AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2)\.
+ [AWS Common Runtime \(CRT\) Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-python)\.
+ [Picamera](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/) \(for Raspberry Pi devices only\)\.
+ [`awscam` module](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deeplens/latest/dg/deeplens-library-awscam-module.html) \(for AWS DeepLens devices\)\.
+ libGL \(for Linux devices\)
<a name="ml-config-useinstaller-default"></a>Default: `true`

## Usage<a name="dlr-component-usage"></a>

Use this component with the `UseInstaller` configuration parameter set to `true` to install DLR and its dependencies on your device\. The component sets up a virtual environment on your device that includes the OpenCV and NumPy libraries that are required for DLR\. 

**Note**  <a name="ml-installer-component-usage-note"></a>
The installer script in this component also installs the latest versions of additional system libraries that are required to configure the virtual environment on your device and to use the installed machine learning framework\. This might upgrade the existing system libraries on your device\. Review the following table for the list of libraries that this component installs for each supported operating system\. If you want to customize this installation process, set the `UseInstaller` configuration parameter to `false`, and develop your own installer script\.


| Platform | Libraries installed on the device system | Libraries installed in the virtual environment | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Armv7l | build\-essential, cmake, ca\-certificates, git | setuptools, wheel | 
| Amazon Linux 2 | mesa\-libGL | None | 
| Ubuntu | wget | None | 

When you deploy your inference component, this runtime component first verifies if your device already has DLR and its dependencies installed, and if not, then it installs them for you\.
