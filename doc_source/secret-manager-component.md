# Secret manager<a name="secret-manager-component"></a>

The secret manager component \(`aws.greengrass.SecretManager`\) deploys secrets from AWS Secrets Manager to Greengrass core devices\. Use this component to securely use credentials, such as passwords, in custom components on your Greengrass core devices\. For more information about Secrets Manager, see [What is AWS Secrets Manager?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*\.

To access this component's secrets in your custom Greengrass components, use the [GetSecretValue](ipc-secret-manager.md#ipc-operation-getsecretvalue) operation in the AWS IoT Device SDK\. For more information, see [Use the AWS IoT Device SDK to communicate with the Greengrass nucleus, other components, and AWS IoT CoreCommunicate with the Greengrass nucleus, other components, and AWS IoT Core](interprocess-communication.md) and [Retrieve secret values](ipc-secret-manager.md)\.

This component encrypts secrets on the core device to keep your credentials and passwords secure until you need to use them\. It uses the core device's private key to encrypt and decrypt secrets\.

## Versions<a name="secret-manager-component-versions"></a>

This component has the following versions:
+ 2\.1\.x
+ 2\.0\.x

## Type<a name="secret-manager-component-type"></a>

<a name="public-component-type-plugin-para1"></a>This component is a plugin component \(`aws.greengrass.plugin`\)\. The [Greengrass nucleus](greengrass-nucleus-component.md) runs this component in the same Java Virtual Machine \(JVM\) as the nucleus\. The nucleus restarts when you change this component's version on the core device\.

<a name="public-component-type-plugin-para2"></a>This component uses the same log file as the Greengrass nucleus\. For more information, see [Monitor AWS IoT Greengrass logs](monitor-logs.md)\.

<a name="public-component-type-more-information"></a>For more information, see [Component types](develop-greengrass-components.md#component-types)\.

## Operating system<a name="secret-manager-component-os-support"></a>

This component can be installed on core devices that run the following operating systems:
+ Linux
+ Windows

## Requirements<a name="secret-manager-component-requirements"></a>

This component has the following requirements:
+ The [Greengrass device role](device-service-role.md) must allow the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` action, as shown in the following example IAM policy\.

  ```
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Action": [
          "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:123456789012:secret:MySecret"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
**Note**  
If you use a customer\-managed AWS Key Management Service key to encrypt secrets, the device role must also allow the `kms:Decrypt` action\.

  For more information about IAM policies for Secrets Manager, see the following in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*:
  + [Authentication and access control for AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html)
  + [Actions, resources, and context keys you can use in an IAM policy or secret policy for AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html)
+ Custom components must define an authorization policy that allows `aws.greengrass#GetSecretValue` to get secrets that you store with this component\. In this authorization policy, you can restrict components' access to specific secrets\. For more information, see [secret manager IPC authorization](ipc-secret-manager.md#ipc-secret-manager-authorization)\.
+ \(Optional\) If you store the core device's private key and certificate in a [hardware security module](hardware-security.md) \(HSM\), the HSM must support RSA keys, the private key must have the `unwrap` permission, and the public key must have the `wrap` permission\.

### Endpoints and ports<a name="secret-manager-component-endpoints"></a>

This component must be able to perform outbound requests to the following endpoints and ports, in addition to endpoints and ports required for basic operation\. For more information, see [Allow device traffic through a proxy or firewall](allow-device-traffic.md)\.


| Endpoint | Port | Required | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  `secretsmanager.region.amazonaws.com`  | 443 | Yes |  Download secrets to the core device\.  | 

## Dependencies<a name="secret-manager-component-dependencies"></a>

## Configuration<a name="secret-manager-component-configuration"></a>

This component provides the following configuration parameters that you can customize when you deploy the component\.

`cloudSecrets`  
A list of Secrets Manager secrets to deploy to the core device\. You can specify labels to define which versions of each secret to deploy\. If you don't specify a version, this component deploys the version with the staging label `AWSCURRENT` attached\. For more information, see [Staging labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/terms-concepts.html#term_staging-label) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*\.  
Each object contains the following information:    
`arn`  
The ARN of the secret to deploy\.  
`labels`  
\(Optional\) A list of labels to identify the versions of the secret to deploy to the core device\.  
Each label must be a string\.

**Example: Configuration merge update**  

```
{
  "cloudSecrets": [
    {
      "arn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyGreengrassSecret-abcdef"
